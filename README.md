# Simran Bhatti ‚Äì Climate & GIS Data Projects

Hello! My name is Simran and I'm a recent Geography‚ÄìData Science graduate from the University of Washington. I specialized multiple programs within GIS and data science like R, QGIS, ArcGIS Online, and Web GIS. My projects span climate change mapping, carbon emissions tracking, and historical migration analysis. Here's a selection of my academic and personal projects.

## üîç Featured Projects

### 1. Mapping Climate Change with QGIS
- Compared historical vs. projected precipitation data across the U.S.
- Used raster datasets, interpolation, and custom symbology.
- Designed inset maps to highlight regional climate impacts.
