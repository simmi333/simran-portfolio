# Simran Bhatti ‚Äì Climate & GIS Data Projects

Hello! My name is Simran and I'm a recent Geography‚ÄìData Science graduate from the University of Washington. I specialized multiple programs within GIS and data science like R, QGIS, ArcGIS Online, and Web GIS. My projects span climate change mapping, carbon emissions tracking, and historical migration analysis. Here's a selection of my academic and personal projects.

## üîç Featured Projects

### 1. Mapping Climate Change with QGIS
- Compared historical vs. projected precipitation data across the U.S.
- Used raster datasets, interpolation, and custom symbology.
- Designed inset maps to highlight regional climate impacts.

### 2. Ferry Ridership Flow Visualization (Python)
- Processed WSDOT data to create a Sankey diagram.
- Analyzed ridership trends and flow patterns.

### 3. Web GIS: Tracking Carbon Emissions in Europe
- Built with HTML, JavaScript, and SQL.
- Interactive time slider, emissions intensity gradients, and popups.
- Designed for public and policymaker engagement.

### 4. Experience in Generative AI Tools

As part of the University of Washington‚Äôs Web GIS course, GEOG 328, taught by Dr. Bo Zhao, I explored the integration of generative AI‚Äîspecifically ChatGPT‚Äîinto the design and development of web-based geographic information systems. This approach enhanced productivity, simplified error analysis, and accelerated the learning curve for front-end development and spatial data handling.

We worked AI tools like  ChatGPT and Copilot, and comapred them to eachother.
